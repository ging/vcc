** cmd-itip.rb

This script pretty-prints iTIP calendar invitations, often sent by email using iMIP
as text/calendar objects.

Download the latest vPim from:

  http://rubyforge.org/projects/vpim/

It requires Ruby to be installed.

Install vpim:

  tar -xzf vpim-XX.tgz
  cd vpim-XX
  ruby install.rb config
  ruby install.rb setup
  sudo ruby install.rb install

Install cmd-itip.rb into your path, perhaps without the extension.

  cp samples/cmd-itip.rb ~/bin/cmd-itip
  chmod +x ~/bin/cmd-itip

Modify your ~/.mailcap or /etc/mailcap files to call cmd-itip, add a line like:

  text/calendar; cmd-itip --myaddr "sroberts@" %s; copiousoutput

If you give a REGEX to --myaddr to tell cmd-itip your email addresses, cmd-itip
will avoid printing some information on the attendees to an invitation.

Modify muttrc to autoview calendars with a command like:

  auto_view text/calendar

Notes on Notes;

Because Domino sends a close-to-unreadable text/plain attachment along with the
text/calendar in a multipart/alternative, and the text/plain is first in the
alternatives, the garbage will be at the top, and the nicely printed calendar
at the bottom. Because of this, I reorder the view preference so the calendar
invitation is clearly printed at the top of the message with a muttrc command
like:

 alternative_order text/calendar text/plain

Domino also includes the calendar twice in the mail message, so you'll see it
twice, I don't know what to do about that.

Notes on application/octet-stream:

Some calendar programs, such as Apple's Mail.app, wrongly send iCalendar attachments
with a content-type of application/octet-stream. In order to be processed correctly, use
the mutt 1.5 or later capability to lookup the correct MIME content-type based on the
file extension. Put this in your muttrc file:

 mime_lookup application/octet-stream

and ensure /etc/mime.types or ~/.mime.types contains:

  text/calendar       ics



** vcf-to-mutt.rb

This script searches a set of vCards can output the results as a Mutt query response,
or a Mutt aliases file.

It used to support querying the OS X Address Book, but that is better done with lbdb, see
http://www.spinnaker.de/lbdb/.

To install, you must:

1 - install vPim (see README)

3 - copy vcf-to-mutt into a directory in your path, such
    as ~/bin, and chmod +x vcf-to-mutt.rb to make it executable.

4 - Put in your muttrc file (either ~/.muttrc or ~/.mutt/muttrc) a line such as:

set query_command = "vcf-to-mutt.rb '%s'"

5 - The query command ("Q") will query the address book, control-t will give you auto-completion
    of email addresses, see the Mutt manual page.


** mutt-aliases-to-vcf.rb

This script converts a mutt aliases file into a vCard file.
