== DESCRIPTION:

Nokogiri (鋸) is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser.  Among Nokogiri's
many features is the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

XML is like violence - if it doesn’t solve your problems, you are not using
enough of it.

== FEATURES:

* XPath support for document searching
* CSS3 selector support for document searching
* XML/HTML builder

Nokogiri parses and searches XML/HTML very quickly, and also has
correctly implemented CSS3 selector support as well as XPath support.

Here is a speed test:
