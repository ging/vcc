description: |
  Return a list of strings as a set of arranged in columns.
  
  For example, for a line width of 4 characters (arranged vertically):
      ['1', '2,', '3', '4'] => '1  3
  2  4
  '
  
  or arranged horizontally:
      ['1', '2,', '3', '4'] => '1  2
  3  4
  '
  
  Each column is only as wide as necessary.  By default, columns are
  separated by two spaces - one was not legible enough. Set "colsep"
  to adjust the string separate columns. Set `displaywidth' to set
  the line width.
  
  Normally, consecutive items go down from the top to bottom from
  the left-most column to the right-most. If +arrange_vertical+ is
  set false, consecutive items will go across, left to right, top to
  bottom.
