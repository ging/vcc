Important Changes
=================

  I've started to work on a new module for reporting. You can see that work
  in lib/garb/model.rb. This will be the API to replace both Garb::Resource
  and Garb::Report. However, it isn't complete yet, so I would advise against
  using it right now. Resource and Report will be deprecated around 0.9.0 and
  I'd like to remove them for 1.0.0. I will start this process after I've
  updated the documentation and I feel that Garb::Model is in a solid place.

  Please read CHANGELOG

Description
-----------

  Provides a Ruby API to the Google Analytics API.

  http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataDeveloperGuide.html

Basic Usage
===========

Single User Login
-----------------
  
    > Garb::Session.login(username, password)
    
OAuth Access Token
------------------

    > Garb::Session.access_token = access_token # assign from oauth gem

Accounts
--------

    > Garb::Account.all

Profiles
--------

    > Garb::Account.first.profiles
    
    > Garb::Profile.first('UA-XXXX-XX')
    
    > Garb::Profile.all
    > profile = Garb::Profile.all.first

Define a Report Class
---------------------

    class Exits
      extend Garb::Resource

      metrics :exits, :pageviews, :exit_rate
      dimensions :page_path
      sort :exits

      filters do
        eql(:page_path, 'season')
      end

      # alternative:
      # filters :page_path.eql => 10
    end

Get the Results
---------------

    > Exits.results(profile)

  OR shorthand

    > profile.exits

Other Parameters
----------------

  * start_date: The date of the period you would like this report to start
  * end_date: The date to end, inclusive
  * limit: The maximum number of results to be returned
  * offset: The starting index

Metrics & Dimensions
--------------------

  Metrics and Dimensions are very complex because of the ways in which the can and cannot be combined.

  I suggest reading the google documentation to familiarize yourself with this.

  http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataReferenceDimensionsMetrics.html#bounceRate

  When you've returned, you can pass the appropriate combinations (up to 50 metrics and 2 dimenstions)
  to garb, as an array, of symbols. Or you can simply push a symbol into the array.

Sorting
-------

  Sorting can be done on any metric or dimension defined in the request, with .desc reversing the sort.

Building a Report
-----------------

  Given the class, session, and profile from above we can do:

    Exits.results(profile, :limit => 10, :offset => 19)

  Or, with sorting and filters:

    Exits.results(profile, :limit => 10, :offset => 19) do
      sort :exits

      filters do
        contains(:page_path, 'season')
        gt(:exits, 100)
      end

      # or with a hash
      # filters :page_path.contains => 'season', :exits.gt => 100
    end

  reports will be an array of OpenStructs with methods for the metrics and dimensions returned.

Build a One-Off Report
----------------------

    report = Garb::Report.new(profile)
    report.metrics :pageviews, :exits
    report.dimensions :page_path
    report.sort :exits

    report.filters do
      contains(:page_path, 'season')
      gte(:exits, 10)
    and

    # or with a hash
    # report.filters :page_path.contains => 'season', :exits.gt => 100

    report.results

Filtering
---------

  Google Analytics supports a significant number of filtering options.

  http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataReference.html#filtering

  We handle filtering as an array of hashes that you can push into, 
  which will be joined together (AND'd)

  Here is what we can do currently:
  (the operator is a method on a symbol metric or dimension)

  Operators on metrics:

    eql => '==',
    not_eql => '!=',
    gt => '>',
    gte => '>=',
    lt => '<',
    lte => '<='

  Operators on dimensions:

    matches => '==',
    does_not_match => '!=',
    contains => '=~',
    does_not_contain => '!~',
    substring => '=@',
    not_substring => '!@'
    
  Given the previous example one-off report, we can add a line for filter:
  
    report.filters do
      eql(:page_path, '/extend/effectively-using-git-with-subversion/')
    end

  Or, if you're comfortable using symbol operators:

    report.filters :page_path.eql => '/extend/effectively-using-git-with-subversion/'

SSL
---

  Version 0.2.3 includes support for real ssl encryption for SINGLE USER authentication. First do:

    Garb::Session.login(username, password, :secure => true)

  Next, be sure to download http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem into your application somewhere.
  Then, define a constant CA_CERT_FILE and point to that file.

  For whatever reason, simply creating a new certificate store and setting the defaults would
  not validate the google ssl certificate as authentic.

TODOS
-----

  * Read opensearch header in results
  * Investigate new features from GA to see if they're in the API, implement if so
  * clarify AND/OR filtering behavior in code and documentation

Requirements
------------

  * crack >= 0.1.6
  * active_support >= 2.2.0

Requirements for Testing
------------------------

  * jferris-mocha
  * tpitale-shoulda (works with minitest)

Install
-------

    sudo gem install garb
