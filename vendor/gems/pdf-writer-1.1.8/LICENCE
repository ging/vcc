== Patents Covering the Adobe PDF Format
=== ADOBE PATENTS
This software is based on Adobe's PDF Reference, Third Edition, version 1.6.
There may be limitations on the use of this library based on patent
restrictions from Adobe. See bewlow for more information.

=== UNISYS LZW PATENT
This software does not fully conform to the Adobe PDF specification because
no support for LZW is included in this software. At the time of original
development of this software (2003), the Unisys LZW patent was still in
effect outside of the United States. This will be modified in a future
version of this software.

== Patent Clarification Notice: Reading and Writing PDF Files
Adobe has a number of patents covering technology that is disclosed in the
Portable Document Format (PDF) Specification, version 1.6 and later, as
documented in PDF Reference and associated Technical Notes (the
"Specification". Adobe desires to promote the use of PDF for information
interchange among diverse products and applications.

Accordingly, the following patents are licensed on a royalty-free, non-
exclusive basis for the term of each patent and for the sole purpose of
developing software that produces, consumes, and interprets PDF files that
are compliant with the Specification:

U.S. Patent Numbers: 5,634,064; 5,737,599; 5,781,785; 5,819,301; 6,028,583;
6,289,364; 6,421,460

In addition, the following patent is licensed on a royalty-free, non-
exclusive basis for its term and for the sole purpose of developing software
that produces PDF files that are compliant with the Specification
(specifically excluding, however, software that consumes and/or interprets
PDF files):

U.S. Patent Numbers: 5,860,074

The above licenses are limited to only those rights required to implement the
Specification and no others. That is to say, Adobe grants only those rights
in the above patent(s) necessarily practiced to implement the Specification,
and does not grant any rights not required to implement the Specification.
The licenses do not grant the right to practice any patent covering other
technologies, such as implementation techniques that are not explicitly
disclosed in the Specification, nor does it allow the use of any patented
feature for any purpose other than as set forth in the applicable license
grant. Adobe has other patents in various fields, none of which are hereby
licensed.
